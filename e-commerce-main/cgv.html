        <p><strong> Clause 1: Purpose and Scope </strong></p>
        <p> These General Terms and Conditions of Sale (GTCS) form the basis of the commercial negotiation and are
            systematically sent or given to each buyer to enable them to place an order. </p>
        <p> The General Terms and Conditions of Sale described below detail the rights and obligations of Romain
            Viktorovich and its customer in connection with the sale of the following goods: </p>
        <ul type="disc" style="margin-bottom:0cm;">
            <li> Photo Books </li>
            <li> Printed Photographs </li>
        </ul>
        <p> Any acceptance of the quote/purchase order, including the clause &quot;I acknowledge that I have read and
            accept the general terms and conditions of sale annexed hereto&quot; implies the buyer&apos;s unreserved
            acceptance of these general terms and conditions of sale. </p>
        <p><strong> Clause 2: Price </strong></p>
        <p> The prices of the goods sold are those in force at the time of the order and are indicated in euros, all
            taxes included. Therefore, they include the VAT applicable on the day of the order. Please note that
            shipping costs will be added separately and specified when finalizing your order. </p>
        <p> Romain Viktorovich reserves the right to change its prices at any time. However, it undertakes to invoice
            the goods ordered at the prices indicated when the order was placed. </p>
        <p><strong> Clause 3: Rebates and Rebates </strong></p>
        <p> The proposed&nbsp; prices &nbsp;include the rebates and rebates that Romain Viktorovitch would have to grant
            in view of its results or the buyer&apos;s assumption of certain services. </p>
        <p><strong> Clause 4: Discount </strong></p>
        <p> It should be clarified that our commercial policy does not include any discount in case of advance payment.
            In other words, we are not able to grant any additional discount or deduction on the price of the goods in
            the event of early payment. </p>
        <p><strong> Clause 5: Terms of payment </strong></p>
        <p> The payment methods for the payment of orders are as follows: </p>
        <ul type="disc" style="margin-bottom:0cm;">
            <li> Payment by credit card: You have the option of paying for your orders using your credit card. We accept
                credit and debit cards issued by major financial institutions. During the checkout process, you will be
                redirected to a secure page where you can enter your card information confidentially. </li>
            <li> PayPal: We also offer the possibility to pay for your orders via PayPal, a secure online payment
                platform. If you choose this option, you will be redirected to the PayPal interface where you can log in
                to your PayPal account and complete the payment with ease. </li>
        </ul>
        <p> &nbsp; </p>
        <p> We have selected these payment methods to provide you with a secure and convenient payment experience.
            Please note that all information provided during the checkout process will be processed in accordance with
            the privacy policy established by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as well as the data
            protection legislation of the competent jurisdiction, such as the Commission Nationale de
            l&apos;Informatique et des Libert&eacute;s (CNIL) in France. If you encounter any difficulties or have any
            questions regarding payment terms, please do not hesitate to contact our customer service team who will be
            happy to assist you. </p>
        <p><strong> Clause 6: Late payment </strong></p>
        <p> In the event of total or partial non-payment of the goods delivered by the due date, the buyer must pay
            Romain Viktorovich a late payment penalty equal to three times the legal interest rate. </p>
        <p> The statutory interest rate is the rate in force on the day the goods are delivered. </p>
        <p> This penalty is calculated on the amount of the outstanding amount, including VAT, and runs from the due
            date of the price without the need for any prior formal notice. </p>
        <p> In addition to the late payment compensation, any sum, including the advance payment, not paid by its due
            date will automatically result in the payment of a lump sum compensation of EUR 40 due in respect of
            recovery costs. </p>
        <p> Articles 441-10 and D. 441-5 of the French Commercial Code. </p>
        <p><strong> Clause No. 7: Termination clause </strong></p>
        <p> If, within fifteen days of the implementation of the &quot;Late payment&quot; clause, the buyer has not paid
            the outstanding sums, the sale will be cancelled by operation of law and may give rise to the right to the
            award of damages in favour of the company Romain Viktorovitch. </p>
        <p><strong> Clause No. 8: Retention of title clause </strong></p>
        <p> Romain Viktorovich retains ownership of the goods sold until the full payment of the price, in principal and
            incidentals. As such, if the buyer is subject to a receivership or judicial liquidation, Romain Viktorovitch
            reserves the right to claim, within the framework of the insolvency proceedings, the goods sold and
            remaining unpaid. </p>
        <p><strong> Clause 9: Delivery </strong></p>
        <p> Delivery is made: </p>
        <ul type="disc" style="margin-bottom:0cm;">
            <li> by handing over the goods directly to the buyer; </li>
        </ul>
        <p> The delivery time indicated when the order is placed is only indicative and is in no way guaranteed. </p>
        <p> As a result, any reasonable delay in the delivery of the products shall not result in the buyer being liable
            to: </p>
        <ul type="disc" style="margin-bottom:0cm;">
            <li> the award of damages; </li>
            <li> Cancellation of the order. (See below) </li>
        </ul>
        <p> The entire transport risk is borne by the buyer. </p>
        <p> In the event of goods missing or deteriorated during transport, the buyer must make all necessary
            reservations on the purchase order upon receipt of the said goods. These reservations must also be confirmed
            in writing within five days of delivery, by registered letter addressed to the company. </p>
        <p><strong> Clause 10: Force Majeure </strong></p>
        <p> Romain Viktorovitch cannot be held liable if the non-performance or delay in the performance of any of its
            obligations described in these general terms and conditions of sale results from a case of force majeure. As
            such, force majeure is defined as any external, unforeseeable and irresistible event within the meaning of
            Article 1148 of the Civil Code. </p>

            resolution of disputes through mediation or arbitration, in accordance with applicable rules and procedures.
            If mediation or arbitration does not result in a satisfactory resolution, then the parties may bring an

        <p> &nbsp; </p>
        <p> Governing Law: These T&amp;Cs shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of France. Any
